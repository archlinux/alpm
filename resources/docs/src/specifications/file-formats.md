# File format specifications

Specifications for various file formats are provided in the context of the [components] that make use of them and are located in a component's `resources/specification/` directory.

The specifications are provided as specially formatted markdown files which can be rendered to [section 5] manpages.

Several versions of specifications may exist side-by-side, but only the latest version is actively supported.
Legacy versions of specifications may be deprecated and removed as needed, if they hinder further development.
