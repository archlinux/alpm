## Concept specifications

Specifications for common fields, composite types and concepts are provided by the [alpm-types] [component] in its `resources/specification/` directory.

The specifications are provided as specially formatted markdown files which can be rendered to [section 7] manpages.

Several versions of specifications may exist side-by-side, but only the latest version is actively supported.
Legacy versions of specifications may be deprecated and removed as needed, if they hinder further development.
