The path "[TEMP_FILE]/foo/bar/baz/beh.txt" does not exist or is not a symlink, but the path "foo/bar/baz/beh.txt" in the ALPM-MTREE data requires it to be:
No such file or directory (os error 2).
The path "[TEMP_FILE]/foo/bar/buh" does not exist, but the path "./foo/bar/buh" in the ALPM-MTREE data requires it to.
The path "[TEMP_FILE]/foo/beh.txt" does not exist, but the path "./foo/beh.txt" in the ALPM-MTREE data requires it to.
