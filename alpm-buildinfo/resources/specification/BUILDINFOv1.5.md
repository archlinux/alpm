# NAME

BUILDINFO - Information on package build environments for ALPM based packages (version 1).

# DESCRIPTION

The **BUILDINFO** format is a textual format that describes a package's build environment.
Such files are located at the root of ALPM packages, are named **.BUILDINFO** and are usually used to reproduce the environment in which a package has been build.
For further information refer to **Arch Linux's reproducible builds effort**[1].

The **BUILDINFO** format exists in multiple versions.
The document describes version 1, which is a legacy version and has been introduced with the release of pacman 5.1.0 on 2018-05-28.
For the latest specification, refer to **BUILDINFO**.

## General Format

A **BUILDINFO** file consists of a series of lines, each providing information on an aspect of the build environment of a package, or the file format itself.
Leading whitespace is always ignored.

Unless noted otherwise, the information contained in a **BUILDINFO** file is considered to be covered by the set of the 95 printable ASCII characters.

## Keywords

Each line encodes information that represents one keyword assignment.
All keyword assignments consist of a key from the following list immediately followed by a whitespace, an '=' sign, another whitespace and a value.

By default, exactly one keyword assignment must be present per keyword in a **BUILDINFO**.
As exception to this rule, the keywords **buildenv**, **options** and **installed** may be provided zero or more times.

### format

The **BUILDINFO** file format version.
The value must be a plain positive integer.
This must be **1** for **BUILDINFO** version 1.

### pkgname

The name of the package.
The value is an **alpm-package-name** (e.g. `example`).

### pkgbase

The **alpm-package-base** of the package.
The value is an **alpm-package-base** (e.g. `example`).

### pkgver

The full version of the package.
Note, that this is not to be confused with **alpm-pkgver**, which only represents a subset of this keyword!
The value is an **alpm-package-version**, either in *full* or in *full with epoch* form (e.g. `1.0.0-1` or `1:1.0.0-1`, respectively).

### pkgarch

The architecture of the package (see **alpm-architecture** for further information).
The value must be covered by the set of alphanumeric characters and '_' (e.g. `x86_64` or `any`).

### pkgbuild_sha256sum

The hex representation of the SHA-256 checksum of the **PKGBUILD** used to build the package.
The value must be covered by the set of hexadecimal characters and must be 64 characters long (e.g. `946d8362de3cebe3c86765cb36671a1dfd70993ac73e12892ac7ac5e6ff7ef95`).

### packager

The User ID of the entity, that built the package.
The value is meant to be used for identity lookups and represents an **OpenPGP User ID**[2].
As such, the value is a UTF-8-encoded string, that is conventionally composed of a name and an e-mail address, which aligns with the format described in **RFC 2822**[3] (e.g. `John Doe <john@example.org>`).

### builddate

The date at which the build of the package started.
The value must be numeric and represent the seconds since the Epoch, aka. 'Unix time' (e.g. `1729181726`).

### builddir

The absolute directory path in which the package has been built by the build tool (e.g. `makepkg`).
The value is a UTF-8-encoded string and must represent a valid absolute directory (e.g. `/builddir`).

### buildenv

A build environment used by the package build tool (i.e. `makepkg`, defined in `BUILDENV` of makepkg.conf) when building the package.
This keyword may be assigned zero or more times.
The value must be a unique word, optionally prefixed by a single '!', which indicates the negation of the environment (e.g. `color` or `!color`).

### options

An option used by the package build tool (i.e. `makepkg`, defined in `OPTIONS` of makepkg.conf) when building the package.
This keyword may be assigned zero or more times.
The value must be a unique word, optionally prefixed by a single '!', which indicates the negation of the option (e.g. `debug` or `!debug`).

### installed

The information about an installed package during build time of the package.
This keyword may be assigned zero or more times.
The value represents a composite string, composed of an **alpm-package-name**, directly followed by a '-' sign, directly followed by an **alpm-package-version** (in *full* or in *full in epoch* form), directly followed by a '-' sign, followed by an **alpm-architecture** (e.g. `example-1:1.0.0-1-x86_64`).
