# alpm-types

Types for **A**rch **L**inux **P**ackage **M**anagement.

The provided types and the traits they implement can be used in package management related applications (e.g. package manager, repository manager, special purpose parsers and file specifications, etc.) which deal with [libalpm](https://man.archlinux.org/man/libalpm.3) based packages.

This library strives to provide all underlying types for writing ALPM based software as a leaf-crate, so that they can be shared across applications and none of them has to implement them itself.
