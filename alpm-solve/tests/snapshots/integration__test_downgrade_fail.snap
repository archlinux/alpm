epic-fail <=4-1 cannot be installed because there are no viable options:
└─ epic-fail 2-1 (package cache) would require
   └─ libnewdep.so.1-64 <any version>, for which no candidates were found.
The following packages are incompatible
├─ neovim =0.9.3-1 can be installed with any of the following options:
│  └─ neovim 0.9.3-1 (package cache)
└─ epic-fail <=4-1 cannot be installed because there are no viable options:
   └─ epic-fail 4-1 (already installed) would constrain
      └─ neovim to not be <=0.9.3-1, which conflicts with any installable versions previously reported
