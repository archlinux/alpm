# ALPM

This project comprises specifications, as well as [Rust] libraries and tools for **A**rch **L**inux **P**ackage **M**anagement.

The ALPM project arose from the need for more clearly specifying the interfaces, as well as providing bindings and tools in a memory-safe programming language.
The specifications and implementations are based on ad-hoc implementations in the [pacman] project.
Currently, this project aims to maintain compatibility with [pacman] `5.1.0` and onwards.

The scope of this project is to provide robust integration for all relevant package creation and consumption, as well as repository management tasks.
As such, the ALPM project also aims at providing drop-in replacements or alternatives for some facilities provided by [pacman].

This project is currently supported by the [Sovereign Tech Agency].

## Components

Currently the following components are available:

- [alpm-mtree]: a library and commandline interface to work with `.MTREE` and `mtree` files
- [alpm-buildinfo]: a library and commandline interface to work with `BUILDINFO` files
- [alpm-parsers]: a library for providing various custom parsers/deserializers for file types used in ALPM
- [alpm-pkginfo]: a library and commandline interface to work with `.PKGINFO` files
- [alpm-types]: a central library for types used by other ALPM libraries and tools
