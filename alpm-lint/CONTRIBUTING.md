# Adding New Lint Rules

## Prerequisites

Before adding a new lint rule, there are a few things that should be taken care of first:

1. Define the problem your lint rule should detect and, if applicable, what needs to be done to resolve it.
1. Read the [`LintRule`] trait implementation to get an overview of the API surface.
1. Take a look at a few existing [`LintRule implementations`] and the [`Example`] to get a rough idea on how to write a lint.

## Checklist

As a guideline, it is advised to follow this checklist:

- [ ] Lint rule file [created](#create-the-lint-rule-file) in correct [scope](#determine-the-scope) directory.
- [ ] Scope, Group and Level are set correctly.
- [ ] Rule is [registered](#register-the-lint-rule) in `LintStore::register()`.
- [ ] Documentation is correct.
- [ ] Eventual [links](#extra-links) or [configuration options](#configuration-options) are exposed via their respective functions.
- [ ] At least [two tests](#write-integration-tests) have been written and are passing.
      If possible include real-world examples that inspired this rule when writing tests.

## [`LintRule`] implementation

### Determine the scope

Figure out which scope the new lint will be applied to:

- `LintScope::SourceInfo` - For [`.SRCINFO`] file-specific lints
- `LintScope::PackageBuild` - For [`PKGBUILD`] file-specific lints  
- `LintScope::PackageInfo` - For [`.PKGINFO`] file-specific lints
- `LintScope::BuildInfo` - For [`.BUILDINFO`] file-specific lints
- `LintScope::SourceRepository` - For lints that need both [`PKGBUILD`] and [`.SRCINFO`]
- `LintScope::Package` - For lints that need both [`.PKGINFO`] and [`.BUILDINFO`]

See the [`LintScope`] API documentation for more detailed information about these scopes.

### Create the lint rule file

Create a new file in the submodules of the respective scope in `src/lint_rules`. E.g. `src/lint_rules/source_info/my_new_lint.rs`.

It is encouraged to use the [`Example`] template as a starting point.
The example gives you a general structure, example functions and commented out optional functions with an explanation on when/how to use them.

If you notice that the example is outdated, please [`open an issue`]!

### Register the lint rule

Once you are finished writing your lint, add the lint to the [`LintStore`]'s `register()` method.
This is fairly straightforward and only involves a single import and one line.

The following example shows how to add `MyNewLint` to `src/lint_rules/store.rs`:

```rust
fn register(&mut self) {
    self.lint_constructors = vec![
        // ...
        DuplicateArchitecture::new_boxed,
        MyNewLint::new_boxed, // <---
        UnsafeChecksum::new_boxed,
        // ...
    ];
}
```

---

**NOTE**
Don't forget to keep that array sorted when adding new lints! We want to keep things organized.

---

## Reporting issues

When your lint rule detects problems, it must report them using the [`LintIssue`] type.
Picking the correct issue type and using good wording is crucial to provide a good user experience.

Inside each [`LintIssue`] is a [`LintIssueType`], which is the type that actually provides detailed information about the issue.
Take a look at the [`SourceInfoIssue`] enum go get an idea of how this looks like.
Be aware that [`SourceInfoIssue`] and equivalents also implement `Into<LintIssueType>` for your convenience.

[`LintIssue`]s and its [`LintIssueType`] are converted to [`LintIssueDisplay`] before being printed, to ensure a consistent formatting across the whole linting framework.
The [`LintIssueDisplay`] documentation explains best how this works, what types of fields there are and how the final layout looks like.

The documentation of [`SourceInfoIssue`] and its equivalent types also provide detailed information on how the various variants' fields are used to create a [`LintIssueDisplay`].

### Creating [`LintIssue`] instances

In your `Lintrule::run()` method, push [`LintIssue`] instances to the `issues` vector:

```rust
fn run(&self, resources: &Resources, issues: &mut Vec<LintIssue>) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Your linting logic here
    if problem_detected {
        issues.push(LintIssue::from_rule(
            SourceInfoIssue::BaseField {
                field_name: "pkgname".to_string(),
                value: "invalid-name".to_string(),
                context: "Invalid package name format".to_string(),
                architecture: None,
            }.into(),
        ));
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

In the example above, a new [`LintIssue`] is created from your lint rule's data, in combination with a [`LintIssueType::SourceInfo`] that is created from the `SourceInfoIssue.into()` call.
In this example, the `SourceInfoIssue::BaseField` variant is used to indicate problems on the `pkgname` field of a SourceInfo's `pkgbase` section.

## Extra links

You can provide extra links for more information to a lint error message.
For this, implement the `extra_links` function of the [`LintRule`] trait for your implementation.

```rs
    /// A link map of `name -> URL` that provide extra context to people that encounter this lint.
    fn extra_links(&self) -> Option<BTreeMap<String, String>>;
```

## Configuration options

If your lint rule needs to be configurable, you might have to add a new configuration options.
For this, you need to adjust the configuration struct in the `alpm-lint-config` crate.
Edit `alpm-lint-config/src/lint_rule.rs` and add your new option to the `create_lint_rule_config!` macro at the bottom of the file:

```rust
linting_config! {
    /// This is a test option
    test_option: String = "This is an option",

    /// Description of your new configuration option
    my_config_option: bool = false,  // Add this line
}
```

Afterwards reference it in your lint rule's `configuration_options()` method as shown in example lint rule.

## Write integration tests

Every lint rule must have at least two integration tests in `tests/lint_rule_tests/{scope}/{rule_name}`.
One for a pass run where the rule is not triggered on correct data, and one fail run where the lint rule properly detects an issue.
If your lint rule covers multiple cases, cover all of these cases via tests.

Also, check out the `tests/fixtures.rs` module in case you need stub data for testing.
